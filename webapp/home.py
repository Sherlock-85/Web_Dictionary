        Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.‚Äù - Chris Pine
                    Especially important for beginners. At first, we're so anxious about knowing everything, especially
                    language syntax.
                    Problem-solving is the skill we end up using most.
                    "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie
                    Programmers are mostly "learn by doing" types. 
                    No amount of academic study or watching other people code can compare 
                    to breaking open an editor and start making mistakes.
                    "Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming."
                     - Joyce Wheeler
